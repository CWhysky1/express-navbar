# express-navbar

Node/Express application that hosts three separate routes. Each route corresponds to a unique assignment I have done.
Each route links to the actual repository of the assigment.
The three assigments are:
    Climate Crisis,
    Typesetting,
    Four Algorithms.
    
Server listens on port 3000.
To start server type node server.js on terminal.
This Node/Express app is deploy on Glitch with instructions set in script of package.json.
